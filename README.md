- 👋 Hi, I’m @Eobsv, graduated Mechatronic student with focus on software development. I'm programming on a daily basis since 2016. My first program was a website when I was twelve years old. Right now I am focused on developing different projects within Flutter and Python.
- 👀 I’m interested in new technologies, IT, brainteasers, almost all sort of games, crime stories and lately drums 🥁. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning:
   - Flutter for private purposes
   - Python for microcontrolers

- I programmed a lot in Matlab, C/C++ during my studies. I have created website for classes with HTML5, CSS, PHP with SQL for managing DB. I created few projects with microcontrollers such as: Arduino and EPS8266. Most challenging were programming FPGA, Cuda and OpenCL.

- Here, I will post my coding journey. 

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Flutter/Python projects, hackathon teams.
