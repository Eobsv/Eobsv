- 👋 Hi, I’m @Eobsv, graduated Mechatronic student with focus on software, especially mobile apps. I'm programming on a daily basis since 2016. My first program was a website when I was twelve years old. Right now I am focused on developing my Master Thesis project which was Flutter App.
- 👀 I’m interested in new technologies, IT, brainteasers, almost all sort of games, crime stories.  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning:
   - Flutter for private purposes from udemy course from @angelabauer;
   - C# for business purposes;
   - How to solve problems in Python.

- I programmed a lot in Matlab, C/C++ during my studies. I have created website for classes with HTML5, CSS, PHP with SQL for managing DB. I created few projects with microcontrollers such as: Arduino and EPS8266. Most challenging were programming FPGA, Cuda and OpenCL.

- Here, I will post my coding journey. 

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Flutter projects, hackathon teams.
